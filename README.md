STAT class project - An analysis of vaccine-related tweets in different regions of France  


To go through our code, please first download the three all_combined_pickle.zip 
Those files were obtained by using the following scripts: scriptAPI3.py to collect the Twitter data and then open_json.py to combine the files 

Then our analysis was done through the tw_analyse4.py script 
Our results and discussion can be found in our report
