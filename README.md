# TwitterNLP - STATS Project 
# An analysis of vaccine-related tweets in different regions of France  

To go through our code, please first download the three all_combined_pickle.zip 

Those files were obtained by using the following scripts: scriptAPI3.py to collect the Twitter data and then open_json.py to combine the files 



Then our analysis was done through the tw_analyse4.py script 

Our results and discussion can be found in our report
